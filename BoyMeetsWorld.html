    <p> This show was a classic 90's TV show on ABC and some on Disney Channel. If you were born in the 90's, you should probably heard of this. This TV show is about the life of Cory Matthews and his family including his best friends Shawn Hunter and Topanga Lawerence. It shows the process of life from 6th grade to college to married. The show deals with a lot issues anyone can go through from child to adult. The key thing I learned from watching 7 seasons of the show is that friends will always be there for you. Once I watched this show, I learned the relationship of Shawn and Cory develop together. They've always been through thick and thin. I learned the true meaning of friendship and of how important it is. That is what I learned from watching ABC's Boy Meets World. </p>
