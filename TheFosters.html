    <p> I don't remember how I got hooked onto the show, but I remember why I kept watching it. This show has many ups and downs. The best part is that most teenagers will relate to almost any issue in this show. Every episode ends on a cliffhanger. After I watched this week's episode, I always want to know what is going to happen next. The episode and the show goes deeper and deeper. The show is about these two bi-racial lesbian married couple raising a family of biological and adopted children. What I leaned from watching this show is that no matter what happens family is always there. A quote from the show that I learned is that "DNA doesn't make a family. Love does." No matter if you are adopted or not, family is always there to help you through the tough times. Especially your parents. I feel like this show is a good TV show to learn from. Which is why I watch ABC Family's The Fosters.</p>
