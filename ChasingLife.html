    <p> Everytime I watch this show. I always want to know what is going to happen next. When I watch, I'm get interested in how the characters are going to deal with the situation they are dealing with. This show is about a young adult who was living a normal life and then all of a sudden getting lukemia and has to get treated by an estranged family member. I watch this show for many reasons. What I learned from watching the show is that it is important to have hope in my life that something will turn out fine. I feel that having hope in life is very important. So that is why I watch ABC Family's Chasing Life. </p>
